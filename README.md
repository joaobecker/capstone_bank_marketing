# Portuguese Bank Marketing Campaign | Capstone Project
  - Performed data wrangling and visualization techniques to identify trends and correlation between the independent variables and dependent variable
  - Use of Machine Learning models to predict what customers are most likely to subscribe to the marketing campaign
  
### Marketing Campaign Goal 
  - The marketing campaign goal is to sell long-term deposits through telemarketing phone calls. The bank agents execute phone calls to a list of clients to see if they are interested in subscribing for a long-term deposit. The result is a binary answer, 'yes' or 'no.'
  
### Results
  - After running three different machine learning models, logistic regression, random forest and gradient boosting classifier, random forest model was the one that obtained the best results.
  - The random forest model can predict the customers that are not going to subscribe with a 99% accuracy and predict 95% of all the potential subscribers in the dataset, while having an AUC of 93.06%.
